        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="legal-meta">Effective date: February 25, 2026</p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how Norwood Atlas ("Norwood Atlas", "we", "our", or "us")
          processes information in connection with the Hush Mode iOS application, related websites, and
          support services (collectively, the "Service"). By downloading, accessing, or using the Service,
          you acknowledge this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Scope and Product Positioning</h2>
        <p>
          Hush Mode is a productivity and digital wellbeing tool. It is not a health, medical, mental
          health, therapeutic, or emergency service, and it is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or
          prevent any medical or psychological condition.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>On-device configuration and usage data:</strong> selected app/category/domain targets,
            delay and snooze settings, prompts, and recap metrics needed for Service functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Subscription and purchase metadata:</strong> product identifiers, entitlement status,
            and renewal state obtained from Apple and/or RevenueCat to enable paid features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical and diagnostic data:</strong> crash, performance, and fraud-prevention signals
            that may be made available by platform providers or service providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support communications:</strong> information you choose to provide when contacting us.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not intentionally collect health records, biometric identifiers, precise geolocation,
          contacts, photos, microphone recordings, or camera content through Hush Mode.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Sources of Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Directly from you through in-app actions and support requests.</li>
          <li>Automatically from your device and operating system as needed to run the Service.</li>
          <li>From third parties involved in purchases, billing, and subscription processing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service and core app functionality.</li>
          <li>Authenticate, provision, and enforce subscription entitlements.</li>
          <li>Monitor reliability, troubleshoot, and protect against abuse, fraud, or misuse.</li>
          <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce legal rights.</li>
          <li>Respond to customer support requests and service-related communications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Legal Bases (EEA/UK, where applicable)</h2>
        <p>
          Where required, we process personal data under one or more of the following legal bases:
          performance of a contract, legitimate interests, legal obligations, and consent (where
          applicable).
        </p>

        <h2>6. On-Device Data</h2>
        <p>
          Hush Mode is designed to keep core settings and recap information on-device where feasible.
          Because device and OS behavior can vary, we do not warrant uninterrupted local persistence or
          recovery of any specific data.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Disclosures to Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We may disclose information in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Service providers and processors:</strong> including Apple and RevenueCat for app
            distribution, billing, and subscription management.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal compliance and protection:</strong> where reasonably necessary to comply with law,
            lawful requests, or protect rights, safety, and security.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with merger, acquisition, financing, or sale
            of assets, subject to applicable legal protections.
          </li>
          <li><strong>With consent:</strong> where you direct or authorize us to share information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not sell personal information for monetary consideration. We do not knowingly process
          personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising through the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Data stored locally in the app generally remains until deleted by you, removed with app deletion,
          or overwritten by app behavior. Data retained by third-party processors is governed by their
          retention schedules and legal obligations.
        </p>

        <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location and provider infrastructure, information may be processed in
          jurisdictions different from your own. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards for
          cross-border transfers.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect information.
          No method of transmission or storage is fully secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Manage or delete local app data via app controls and device deletion.</li>
          <li>Manage subscriptions through Apple App Store account settings.</li>
          <li>
            Request access, correction, deletion, or portability rights where provided by applicable law.
          </li>
          <li>Object to or restrict processing where applicable law grants such rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
          information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information,
          contact us so we can take appropriate action.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Third-Party Terms</h2>
        <p>
          Apple, RevenueCat, and other third-party providers may process data under their own terms and
          privacy notices. We are not responsible for third-party privacy practices outside our control.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Updated versions are effective when posted unless a
          later date is stated. Continued use of the Service after updates constitutes acknowledgment of the
          revised terms.
        </p>
