        <p class="legal-meta">Effective date: February 25, 2026</p>

        <p>
          These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Hush Mode iOS app and related

          <li>You may use Hush Mode only in compliance with applicable laws and App Store rules.</li>
          <li>You are responsible for your device, account, and subscription activity.</li>
          <li>You agree not to misuse, reverse engineer, or disrupt the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Paid features are offered as subscriptions through Apple App Store billing.</li>

          <li>Pricing, free trials, and billing terms are shown in the App Store at purchase time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Availability and Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time to improve app performance,
          security, and product quality.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          Hush Mode is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee uninterrupted service or
          that the app will meet every individual expectation.
        </p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, Hush Mode and its operators are not liable for indirect,

        </p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may limit or terminate access to Hush Mode if these Terms are violated or if continued access
          poses risk to the service.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms periodically. Continued use after updates means you accept the revised
          Terms.
