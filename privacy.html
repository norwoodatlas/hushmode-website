        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="legal-meta">Effective date: February 25, 2026</p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how Hush Mode ("we", "our", or "us") handles information when
          you use the Hush Mode iOS app.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>App preferences and session data needed to provide core Hush Mode features.</li>
          <li>Subscription status to unlock paid features.</li>
          <li>No direct sale of personal information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide and improve focus-session, shielding, and recap functionality.</li>
          <li>To determine feature access for free and paid tiers.</li>
          <li>To maintain app reliability and troubleshoot issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>On-Device Data</h2>
        <p>
          Hush Mode is designed to keep core usage data on-device where possible, including settings and
          recap history.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Hush Mode may rely on third-party services to operate parts of the app:</p>

          Data stored in the app remains available until you delete it in-app or remove the app from your
          device.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Hush Mode is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data
