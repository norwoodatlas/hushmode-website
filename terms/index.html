        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p class="legal-meta">Effective date: February 25, 2026</p>

        <p>
          These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") form a legally binding agreement between you and Norwood
          Atlas ("Norwood Atlas", "we", "our", or "us") governing your access to and use of Hush Mode and
          related services (collectively, the "Service"). By downloading, accessing, or using the Service,
          you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility and Authority</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You must have legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</li>
          <li>
            If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may use the Service only with
            parent or legal guardian permission.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you use the Service on behalf of an entity, you represent you are authorized to bind that
            entity to these Terms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. License Grant and Restrictions</h2>
        <p>
          Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Norwood Atlas grants you a limited, revocable,
          non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Service for personal,
          non-commercial purposes.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code.</li>
          <li>You may not bypass technical limitations, security controls, or subscription gates.</li>
          <li>You may not use the Service for unlawful, harmful, abusive, or fraudulent purposes.</li>
          <li>You may not copy, distribute, rent, lease, sell, or exploit the Service except as permitted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Not a Health, Medical, or Therapeutic Service</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is a productivity and digital wellbeing tool only. It is not a health app, not a
          medical device, and not a provider of medical, mental health, therapeutic, or emergency services.
          The Service does not provide clinical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or crisis intervention.
        </p>

        <h2>4. No Guarantee of Results</h2>
        <p>
          We make no guarantee that use of the Service will improve focus, reduce screen time, or produce
          any specific behavioral, productivity, wellness, or personal outcome. Results, if any, depend on
          many factors outside our control.
        </p>

        <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You are responsible for your device, account credentials, and all activity under your account.</li>
          <li>You must comply with applicable laws and App Store terms.</li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for reviewing and using app settings appropriately for your own needs and
            circumstances.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Subscriptions, Billing, and Refunds</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Paid features are offered through Apple in-app subscriptions.</li>
          <li>Billing, renewals, cancellations, and refunds are administered by Apple under Apple's terms.</li>
          <li>
            Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled in your Apple account settings before renewal.
          </li>
          <li>Pricing and product availability may change at any time as permitted by applicable law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Apple and Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Service may rely on Apple APIs, app distribution services, and third-party providers, such as
          RevenueCat. Those services may be governed by separate terms. To the maximum extent permitted by
          law, Norwood Atlas is not responsible for third-party services, outages, or policies.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Service, including all software, design, content, trademarks, and related intellectual
          property, is owned by or licensed to Norwood Atlas and protected by law. Except for the limited
          license above, no rights are granted to you.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Feedback License</h2>
        <p>
          If you submit suggestions, feedback, or ideas, you grant Norwood Atlas a worldwide, perpetual,
          irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, modify, and commercialize such feedback without
          restriction or compensation.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Availability and Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify, suspend, discontinue, or restrict any part of the Service at any time, with or
          without notice, including for maintenance, security, legal compliance, or product changes.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE,"
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
          MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, QUIET ENJOYMENT,
          ACCURACY, OR THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NORWOOD ATLAS AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
          CONTRACTORS, LICENSORS, AND AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
          CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA,
          GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS.
        </p>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF NORWOOD ATLAS FOR ALL CLAIMS
          ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE
          AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO NORWOOD ATLAS THROUGH THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING
          RISE TO LIABILITY, OR (B) FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (USD $50).
        </p>

        <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Norwood Atlas and its affiliates, personnel,
          licensors, and service providers from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments,
          losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or related to
          your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any law or third-party
          rights.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Termination and Suspension</h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, if we
          reasonably believe you violated these Terms, pose a risk to the Service, or where legally
          required. Upon termination, your license to use the Service immediately ends.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Governing Law and Dispute Forum</h2>
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by applicable law, these Terms are governed by the laws applicable in the
          jurisdiction where Norwood Atlas is established, excluding conflict-of-laws principles. You agree
          that disputes shall be brought in courts of competent jurisdiction in that location unless
          mandatory law requires otherwise.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AND NORWOOD ATLAS AGREE TO BRING CLAIMS ONLY IN AN
          INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
          ACTION, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
        </p>

        <h2>17. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may revise these Terms at any time. Revised Terms are effective when posted unless a later date
          is specified. Your continued use of the Service after updated Terms are posted constitutes your
          acceptance of the revised Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>18. Severability and Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the
          maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force. These Terms and
          any policies expressly incorporated by reference constitute the entire agreement between you and
          Norwood Atlas regarding the Service.
        </p>
